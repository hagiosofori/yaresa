2. enter the details.
    : validate the form by including this in the page; 
        <script src="../js/jquery-validation/dist/jquery.validate.min.js"></script>

requirement 2: using jqueryui to put basic registration on the same page as the home page. (to maintain the header and side menu)

1. copy the code, and paste on the home page.

2. place the code in a div, and use jqueryui to make it it's own page.

















want to implement the records feature.

1. entering a patient who's visiting for the first time.
    : what's the workflow for this?

    1. add community member.
        : on the reports home page, a button to add a new community member.

        : that opens the form to be filled.

        : the form has basic, opd, vaccine and family planning tabs.







•	Number of community members who accessed OPD services in a period.
•	Number of newly insured [NHIS expiry not considered] members. Same as number of new members who are insured.
•	Number of non-insured new members.
•	Number of old insured community members.
•	Number of old uninsured members.
•	NHIS expiry [in the next 3 months]
•	OPD cases in the last 30 days
•	vaccine within a week before or after the current date
•	vaccine this month [view children due for vaccination in the current month]
•	vaccine next month
•	Below 2 years [isn’t this a repetition of age]?
•	count [showing number of community members registered in each community]
•	new community members visiting for the first time in the current month
